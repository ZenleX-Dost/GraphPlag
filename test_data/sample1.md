## Introduction

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Key Concepts

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

## Applications

Machine learning has numerous applications in various fields:

- **Healthcare**: Disease diagnosis and treatment prediction
- **Finance**: Fraud detection and risk assessment
- **E-commerce**: Product recommendations
- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles

## Conclusion

As machine learning continues to evolve, it promises to revolutionize how we interact with technology and solve complex problems.
